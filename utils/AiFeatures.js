        Retain essential technical terms but simplify complex sentences.
        If the document contains examples or case studies, summarize their key insights instead of omitting them.
        Make sure to include:

        Main concepts and core ideas
        Key definitions and important facts
        Explanations of critical points without excessive detail
        Please always give me response in JSON format for example :

          data:"Your response here",
          type: "heading2"

    In the code don't add code block delimiter or triple backtick Just give me the code.
        Format the response as follows:
